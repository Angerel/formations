# Goal

This repository aims at exposing the diverse projects that I have been creating to improve my knowledge.\
It also allows one to list all the languages I am proficient in.

Each folder will be centered around one language or one framework, whether it is frontend, backend or for another use.
To serve this purpose, more information will be delivered in each folder, with another README

Furthermore, each and every frontend will display a todolist application, along with a live chat.
Paired with the frontend, any backend will expose a REST API providing the todolist endpoints, and a Websocket to give the live messages
